            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a multimedia artist, working hard to be just an artist, not a starving one...</p>
            <p>I got my first taste for drawing in 1978, at the tender age of 8. Over the years I was vastly inspired by artists such as Frank Frazetta, Jean Giraud (Mobeus), and Simon Bisely.</p>
            <p>Sadly, by the time I finished high school in 1989 and joined the Marines, no one had given me an iPad, and I shelved my drawing career.</p>
            <p>Before I finished high school, however, I discovered the joys of blacksmithing and building and painting various miniatures, especially Games Workshop's.</p>
            <p>Now, after too many years of federal service, I have pledged myself to my art, and I want to bring whatever joy I can into the world with my craftiness.</p>
